/*
    Usually in any function, arguments are passed by their values (int, char, etc).
    What this means is, the function creates another copy of the variable with the same value given,
    and then uses that local variable throughout it's runtime. When we come out of the function,
    this variable is de-allocated. So our real variable still has the same value.
    But we can pass an address to a function, so the function can edit the bucket rather than a copy.
