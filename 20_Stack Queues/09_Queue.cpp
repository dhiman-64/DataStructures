/*
    A Queue has a Front and a Rear part.
    It is a linear data structure and the ordering is FIFO (First In First Out)

    There are 3 major operations in queue
    1. PUSH operation - inserts ONLY on rear end.
    2. POP operation - removed ONLT from front end.
    3. Get Front - gives data at the front.

    Real Life Application:
        1.  Snake Game (snake's length can increase using queue data structure)
        2.  Servers use a queue method to deliver to customers, accept requests, etc.
        3.  ATM/Market/ Any other line for registration, etc. People are served first come first served.
        4.  Tree and Graphs are VERY IMPORTANT and they implement some algorithms using queue data structure
